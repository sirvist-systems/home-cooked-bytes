# Codex Active Tasks (This Session)

Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-12 06:49

Rules:
- Max 3 items in **Doing**.
- Any new idea goes to `00_current/codex_backlog.md` unless explicitly promoted.
- If a task needs more than 2 concrete sub-steps, split it.

## Doing
- [ ] Verify `sirvist-checkpoint` artifacts exist for this session (folder path + key files) and record the pointer in `session_continuity/`.

  - Checkpoint pointer: `session_continuity/summaries/20260213_session_handoff.md`

## Next (Top 10)

Ordered list of the next highest-value tasks to pick up (beyond **Doing**).

1) [ ] Confirm Bifrost region routing + provider setup flow (Vertex/Gemini MaaS)
2) [ ] Rebuild “3-region Bifrost” consumption points (LangGraph + any scripts) to select per-region endpoints intentionally.
3) [ ] Verify `sirvist-checkpoint` artifacts exist for this session and record pointer in `session_continuity/`.
4) [ ] Explore safe repo automation workflows (IP-safe)
5) [ ] Improve repo orientation docs (reduce drift)
6) [ ] Patent sprint toolchain v1: scaffold `tools/patent_sprint/` (isolated, multi-pass, Neo4j-first)
7) [ ] Create/standardize a frictionless “manual continuity” workflow for migration.
8) [ ] Migrate to clean repo (define scope: what to carry vs drop; create new repo skeleton).
9) [ ] Enable GitHub auto-delete merged branches (repo setting).
10) [ ] Decide fate of `paths.py` (enforced import discipline vs optional helper).

## Done
- [x] Captured checkpoint pointer for migration stability: `session_continuity/summaries/20260213_session_handoff.md`. (GH-ISSUE: 2)
- [x] Stabilize Codex MCP set for migration (minimal servers + verified config load). (GH-ISSUE: 3)
