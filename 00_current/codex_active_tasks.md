# Codex Active Tasks (This Session)

Timestamp (UTC): 2026-02-12 06:49

Rules:
- Max 3 items in **Doing**.
- Any new idea goes to `00_current/codex_backlog.md` unless explicitly promoted.
- If a task needs more than 2 concrete sub-steps, split it.

## Doing
- [ ] Verify `sirvist-checkpoint` artifacts exist for this session (folder path + key files) and record the pointer in `06_session_continuity/sessions/manual/`.

  - Checkpoint pointer: `06_session_continuity/sessions/manual/021226_014821_config_toml_environment_stabilize_for_migrate/`

## Next
- [ ] Create/standardize a frictionless “manual continuity” workflow for migration (what gets captured, where it goes, and the restart command).
- [ ] Migrate to clean repo (define scope: what to carry vs drop; create new repo skeleton).

## Done
- [x] Captured checkpoint pointer for migration stability: `06_session_continuity/sessions/manual/021226_014821_config_toml_environment_stabilize_for_migrate/`.
- [x] Stabilize Codex MCP set for migration (minimal servers + verified config load).
