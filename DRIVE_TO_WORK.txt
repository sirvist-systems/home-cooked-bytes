DRIVE TO WORK (WSL)

Update (UTC): 2026-02-15 03:49:30Z

This file is the **daily-start SSOT for this machine**. Don’t duplicate these steps
in other docs—link here.

Start here (home-cooked-bytes only):
1) `cd /home/sirvist-lab/src/home-cooked-bytes`
2) Ensure env is loaded (pick one):
   - Recommended: `direnv allow` (first time only; then it auto-loads)
   - Manual: `source scripts/mcp/env.sh`
3) Start local services: `bash scripts/mcp/up.sh`
4) SSOT gate (stack is actually usable): `bash scripts/mcp/healthcheck.sh`
5) Start Codex **in this same shell** (so it inherits env vars): `codex`

Optional (deeper “is LLM responding?” gate):
- `HEALTHCHECK_OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b bash scripts/mcp/healthcheck.sh`

What you do NOT have to do each time:
- You do NOT need to activate a venv (unless working on MCP deps).
- You do NOT need to manually export env vars if `direnv` is installed.
- You do NOT need to run any “init” step.

Alignment (60 seconds):
1) `session_continuity/summaries/20260213_session_handoff.md` (or latest)
2) `00_current/codex_active_tasks.md`

If Codex shows MCP/handshake errors:
1) Re-run the SSOT gate: `bash scripts/mcp/healthcheck.sh`
2) Re-run Codex MCP init: `codex /mcp`
3) If still broken, check: `docs/mcp/MCP_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`

Rules:
- Keep sessions split by repo; sirvist-lab is read-only quarry.
- If Codex throws MCP errors, re-run the SSOT gate.

Required tools (install once, then forget):
- `direnv`
- `jq`
- `jd`
