DRIVE TO WORK (WSL)

Update (UTC): 2026-02-13 15:53:06Z

Start here (home-cooked-bytes only):
1) `cd /home/sirvist-lab/src/home-cooked-bytes`
2) `direnv allow`  # first time only; after that it auto-loads env vars
3) `bash scripts/mcp/up.sh`
4) `codex`

What you do NOT have to do each time:
- You do NOT need to activate a venv.
- You do NOT need to manually export env vars if direnv is installed.
- You do NOT need to run any “init” step.

Alignment (60 seconds):
1) `session_continuity/summaries/20260213_session_handoff.md`
2) `00_current/codex_active_tasks.md`

Rules:
- Keep sessions split by repo; sirvist-lab is read-only quarry.
- If Codex throws MCP errors, re-run step 2.

Required tools (install once, then forget):
- `direnv`
- `jq`
- `jd`
