# Plans

Update (UTC): 2026-02-13 08:57:00Z

This folder contains implementation plans.

## Conventions (hybrid)

Each plan lives in its own folder and uses a hybrid model:

- `plan.md` is a living document (edit in place as the implementation evolves).
- `changelog.md` is append-only (newest entries at top) to preserve the narrative of changes.

## Active plans

- `PLAN-0001-session-continuity/`
- `PLAN-0002-dingleberry-protocol/`
