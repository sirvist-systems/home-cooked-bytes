# Workstreams

This repo (`home-cooked-bytes`) is the **Lab OS**: planning, standards, and reusable abstractions.

## lab_os (this repo)
- Purpose: decision trail, lightweight workflows, reusable interfaces/adapters, minimal tooling.
- Goal: keep it clean and predictable.

## patents (mission repo)
- Repo: `sirvist-patents-clean`
- Purpose: focused patent sprint work with minimal noise.

## product_mission_repos (future)
Spin up focused repos when a workstream becomes “buildable” and should not be mixed with lab/tooling noise.
