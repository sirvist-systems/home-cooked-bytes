# Decisions Changelog (Append-only)

Update (UTC): 2026-02-13 09:02:00Z

This file records changes to the **decision system itself** (templates, folder structure,
process changes). It is not a substitute for:

- `docs/decisions/decision-log.md` (repo-wide decisions)
- `docs/decisions/adr/` (ADRs)

## 2026-02-13 09:02:00Z

- Introduced `docs/plans/` as a hybrid planning system (`plan.md` living + `changelog.md` append-only).
- Renamed plan-local `decisions.md` to `changelog.md` to avoid confusion with repo-wide decision logs.
