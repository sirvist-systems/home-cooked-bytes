# Session Continuity

Update (UTC): 2026-02-13 10:15:55Z

This folder contains **tracked** (git-committed) continuity artifacts for the
`home-cooked-bytes` repo.

## What belongs here

- `summaries/`: daily session handoffs you can read in ~60 seconds.

## What does NOT belong here

- Raw logs, large dumps, or local-only databases.

If/when we add local-only continuity stores (sqlite, raw transcripts, etc.), they should live in a
gitignored location.
